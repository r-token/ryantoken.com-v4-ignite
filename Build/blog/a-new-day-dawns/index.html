        <p><strong>day sheet</strong> \ ˈdā-ˌshēt \ <em>noun</em> : a concise snapshot of the day ahead that is shared with the touring party.</p>
        <p>After more than four incredible years of building <a href="https://storyboard.com">Storyboard</a>, I’m joining <a href="https://www.daysheets.com">Daysheets</a> as a senior software engineer working across Apple platforms with Swift and SwiftUI.</p>
        <p>My decision to switch gears has less to do with leaving Storyboard and much more to do with joining Daysheets. I’ve narrowed down why I’m fired up about Daysheets to the following reasons:</p>
        <p>First, what is Daysheets? The short version is software to solve tour and production management for artists and their tour managers.</p>
        <p>As mentioned at the top, a day sheet is a music industry term for a physical sheet of paper that tour managers slide under the doors of the artists and touring party every day of a tour detailing that day’s itinerary. The core Daysheets product is exactly that, but enhanced by software and AI, and accessible across your devices. It’s sleek, modern, mobile-friendly, and growing fast.</p>
        <p>But it doesn’t stop there. Daysheets is expanding into <a href="https://www.daysheets.travel">travel</a> - think flight coordination, hotel bookings, and bus routes. Planning all of that for every leg of a tour is a nightmare for tour managers and travel agents. There is so much opportunity to streamline this for the industry.</p>
        <p>I’m beyond excited to help build the future of the product, dig into native macOS development, and integrate even further with AI.</p>
        <p>Beyond the product opportunity, I’m drawn to this even further because I love music and always have. I play guitar and piano, played in rock bands all through high school (and one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU9zvfSFGm4">ska band</a>), and enjoy learning about what life on the road is really like for artists and the folks surrounding them. This role gets me closer to that world.</p>
        <h2>The founders</h2>
        <p>The co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benmelman/">Ben Melman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-sheldon/">Isaac Sheldon</a>, have what you need.</p>
        <p>Ben was a production manager and tour manager for ten years in the music industry. He knows the customer we’re building for because he <em>was</em> that customer for a decade.</p>
        <p>Isaac has an extensive software engineering history of leading teams at and writing software for Microsoft, Google, Zillow, and more.</p>
        <p>That’s a powerful duo, and one that I know I can and will learn a lot from.</p>
        <p>I joined Storyboard in 2021 largely because of the fit and energy I felt between the founder and the industry they were going after at the time. I feel that same fire from the founders at Daysheets.</p>
        <h2>Going deep on Swift</h2>
        <p>As some in the software industry zag away from native development in favor of cross-platform alternatives like React Native and Flutter, Daysheets is zigging. They’re embracing Apple’s first-class development ecosystem around Swift and SwiftUI. I think that’s the right move long term.</p>
        <p>Personally, I’ve never been more enthusiastic about <a href="https://www.swift.org">Swift</a>. Both Apple and the broader Swift community are <a href="https://www.swift.org/platform-steering-group/">pushing hard</a> for it to be embraced across a wide variety of environments, including the cloud, the command line, embedded software like microcontrollers, and of course iOS and the rest of Apple’s platforms. I recently wrote about <a href="/blog/serverless-swift">my own experience</a> writing and deploying Swift onto AWS Lambda to remotely control the Philips Hue lightbulbs here at my house when my favorite teams score or win.</p>
        <p>The vision is <strong>Swift everywhere</strong>. Swift on <a href="https://www.swift.org/getting-started/swiftui/">iOS</a>, Swift in the <a href="https://www.swift.org/get-started/cloud-services/">cloud</a>, Swift on the <a href="https://www.swift.org/get-started/command-line-tools/">command line</a>, Swift on <a href="https://skip.tools">Android</a>, Swift on <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-everywhere-windows-interop/">Windows</a>… You get the idea.</p>
        <p>Swift is my favorite programming language, SwiftUI clicked for me immediately when it was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204">introduced</a> in 2019, and I couldn’t be more excited to go even deeper with all of it at Daysheets.</p>
        <h2>I love startups</h2>
        <p>Four years at Storyboard proved to me that the startup world is an amazing place for me to be, at least at this point in my career. I’m drawn to the energy and scrappiness, I thrive in a small, tight-knit group, and I love the ownership and agency I’m trusted with.</p>
        <p>I also can’t get enough of the “prove it” attitude startups must have to win. There are always bigger, more established, incumbents. You have to prove, over and over again, that your product is that much better than what’s out there. So much so that folks should change what they’re comfortable with and use your thing instead. That takes determination, grit, and a whole lot of hard work. I’m stoked to help build that product for the touring industry.</p>
        <h2>Let’s go</h2>
        <p>I start today. June 9, 2025. The same day that Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">WWDC 2025</a> kicks off. Starting a new Swift-heavy role on the biggest day of the year for Swift developers. Extremely fitting. I can’t wait.</p>
